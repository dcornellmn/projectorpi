# projectorpy
Python/Flask API to control a serial projector using HTTP.

Designed for a friend to control a Vivitek projector using a Raspberry Pi, but it should work on any Python environment. The code is intended to be extensible to support other projector models in the future.

Currently it does work but the code is in a rough pre-beta stage. Use at your own risk! Documentation may be forthcoming if I get around to it.
